If you're a beginner looking for some project in Frontend Development then this will be a perfect video for you to create something along with learning ReactJS.

If you have a basic understanding of ReactJS and Javascript then you will be able to follow along very easily, I have used pure CSS to style my clone, and also a fairly good amount of HTML5 is used in this video. Code along with me and you'll have a great learning experience in this one.
